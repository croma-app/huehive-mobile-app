### Building web version
``` expo web:build ```
This will generate web-build directory. Relative path does not work with this so you have to host it in the root. 

# Expo commands
``` expo start -w ``` for starting the web version.
``` expo start -w --no-dev ``` for production version. 

### Prettier
```  prettier --write "**/*.js" ```
